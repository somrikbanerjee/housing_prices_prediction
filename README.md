## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

The goal is to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the top 5 features influencing the sale price are:

1. Area of second floor (2ndFlrSF)
2. Whether or not the roof is made of wood shingles (RoofMatl_WdShngl)
3. Age of the house in years at the time of sale (YrsAtSale)
4. Rating of finished area of a Type 1 basement (BsmtFinSF1)
5. Whether or not the house is near positive off-site feature park, green belt, etc. (Condition2_PosN)
